      <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="" lang="EN-GB">The
          intention and common interest of the author and the licensees
          is to develop and continuously improve a good base library for
          development of their applications, and will jointly pursue
          after efficient and high level development work in order to
          produce good and useful software from which all of them will
          benefit. In long term, the author intends to broaden the
          circle of developers and users of the software and may
          eventually release the software under a free open source
          license in order to attract a broader community of
          collaborative developers and users. The intention of the
          author and licensees is to maintain longer term collaboration
          on the development and use of the software.</span></p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="" lang="EN-GB">Within
          the period in which licensees and the author will jointly work
          on the library, any contributors will be respoinsible for
          maintaining integrity and good quality of the library. They
          will refrain from any actions that might harm the usability,
          quality or good reputation of the library. <br>
        </span></p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="" lang="EN-GB">Within
          the period in which the software is used as base library for
          development of derivative works at licensees' institutions,
          main contributors to the libraries derived from the software
          will be granted similar rights on those deroved libraries as
          stated in the current license agreement. This means that the
          main contributors will be able to use the developed libraries
          to which they contribute over this period, under similar terms
          as stated in this license agreement, to derive their own
          products from these libraries. In particular, they will be
          allowed to use, license, sell, and distribute such derivative
          works without any limitations, except that the source code of
          these derivative works</span><span style="" lang="EN-GB"> (and
          also of the software</span><span style="" lang="EN-GB"> that
          is the subject of this license agreement) may not be
          distributed. However, this right will be granted only for
          libraries and applications that do not contain any trade
          secrets or vital knowhow that is used for commercial purposes
          (and which the involved institutions - the licensees - do not
          want to reveal publically). Such non-disclosable contents will
          be separated from the basic technical libraries and put into
          specialized units (applications and high-lever libraries).
          Contributors who will be granted the rights from the current
          paragraph will be selected by the author of the software.<br>

      <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="" lang="EN-GB">In
          addition to the rights stated in the previous paragraph, the
          author of the software, Igor Grešovnik, will retain the right
          to spawn his own continuous development thread for any of the
          derivative libraries mentioned in the previous paragraph, and
          to use, develop and copyright such a newly created library
          without any limitations. In the case that such a fork event
          occurs, the author must assign a new name to his forked
          version of the library, and may only include in this version
          the code of the original library that was created before the
          fork event occurred, unless agreed otherwise by the copyright
          holder of the original library.<br>
        </span></p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="" lang="EN-GB">Licensees










          will pursue the goal that the products derived from the

          especially when creation of such derivative works is partially
          or fully supported by public funding. <br>

      <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="" lang="EN-GB">The

          whenever publishing any kind of written work where parts of
          the work are produced by the software and/or derivative works
          that include elements of the software. When the software or
          derivative software takes an important role in producing the
          results, author of the software will be stated as co-author of
          the work. The software web page will be referenced when the
          software or its derivative works are used to produce parts of
          the published work, as well as an appropriate number of
          journal publications related to the software and its
