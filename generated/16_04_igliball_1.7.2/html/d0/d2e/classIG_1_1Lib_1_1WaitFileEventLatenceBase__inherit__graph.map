Directory is specified in constructor or by setting the DirectoryPath property. Waiting is performed by calling the Wait() function. It is implemented by successively checking whether unblocking condition is fulfilled and by sleeping between checks. Therefore it has some latency (i.e. unblocking is not always performed immediatley the condition is met) and spends some CPU time and system resources." alt="" coords="889,98,1077,139"/>
