Used to transfer parameters input (e.g. vector of parameters, request flags) to the vector function and to store function output results (e.g. values, their gradients, error codes, and flags indicating what has actually been calculated). REMARKS: Property CopyReferences specifies whether only references are copied when individial object fields are assigned and set (when the property is true), or values are actually copied (when false &#45; deep copy). Each setter method also has the variant that always copies only the reference (function name appended by &quot;Reference&quot;). This makes possible to avoid duplication of allocated data and also to avoid having different data with the same references.
